# Task Manager
Lightweight, cross-platform task management application with a C++ backend and a simple HTML/JS frontend.

## 🚀 Features
- **Full CRUD**: Create, Read, Update (mark complete), Delete tasks  
- **RESTful API** on C++ with **Oat++** for high-performance request handling  
- **HTML/JavaScript Frontend**: Minimalistic UI served via a standalone HTTP server  
- **CORS Support**: Automatic CORS headers via an Oat++ interceptor for cross-port communication

## 📷 Screenshots
_Main interface_: enter a new task at the top, click **Добавить**, then manage tasks in the list. Each task row shows the description on the left and buttons on the right — ✅ to mark complete (strikethrough style) and 🗑️ to delete.
